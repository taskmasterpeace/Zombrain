Base Background Information and Weapon Situation:

Stronghold: The entire base complex comprising Haven, Strongbox, and the Hospital.

Haven: A House, our safehouse where we repawn, located at the bottom right corner of the four houses in the cul-de-sac, Haven is a two-story house within the Stronghold, serving as a respawn point for the Ghosts of Louisville faction. It features a kitchen, garage, and largely dismantled furniture. Haven is intentionally messy to appear non-threatening.
Strongbox: Hidden just inside the tree line at the end of the cul-de-sac, directly north of Haven, and part of the Stronghold. Surrounded by a log structure filled with cars and an old, broken-down RV, it's located within a forested area further inside the tree line, beyond Haven.
Hospital: not a real hospital An unfinished three-story structure in the Stronghold, referred to as the "hospital" for deceptive purposes. Situated inside Strongbox, close to Haven, it has a U-shaped wall, a door, and stairs leading to the second floor. Once completed, it will serve as a primary hideout. The hospital is under construction, aiming to create a kill zone at the staircase.
Weapon Situation: Weapons and ammo storage is in a trailer near the hospital, within the Stronghold's fortified area. There is no shortage of weapons and melee weapons, but ammunition is limited. The trailer contains numerous guns, clips, and melee weapons. building this to be effecitant and self sustaining is the goal
